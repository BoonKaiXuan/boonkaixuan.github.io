    <h1>Alice Boon</h1>
    <h3>"You don't need a perfect plan — you just need a first step."</h3>
    <p>Apa khabar! I'm Alice, but not the 'Alice' in Wonderland. Curious why I greeted you in Malay? That's because
        I'm Malaysian! I'm Chinese, although sometimes people would assume I'm Malay, which I have no idea why. I was
        born in Malacca, raised in Muar, my kampung is in Simpang Renggam, and I'm currently living in Kuala
        Lumpur.</p>
    <p>A quick overview of me: I'm an introvert, a mild perfectionist (I think), and I love art, design, and nature.
        Party? No,
        thanks. Clubbing?
        Nope. Watching movies in my room? Yess. Socializing drains an introvert's energy, but it doesn't mean we cannot
        talk to people. </p>
    <p>So, that's a little about me. Nice to meet you!</p>
